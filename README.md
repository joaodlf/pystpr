# PyStPr

**Python** **St**(atistics) & **Pr**(obabilities). Easy to use Data Analysis functions for developers.

Inspired from a number of sources,

* [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/) by Allen B. Downey

**Note:** This code is, at best, messy. There are many inconsistencies when it comes function arguments (sometimes it's Numpy arrays, sometimes not...) and overall code organization. I use this as my Data Analysis test grounds.

### Installing

pip install pystpr

### Requirements
* NumPy
